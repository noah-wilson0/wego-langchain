    "- For each ideated A01(명소), A02(음식점), A03(카페), and B01(숙소), call it with the human title you chose.\n"
    "- When calling the MCP tool, DO NOT include suffixes such as '점', '본점', '지점', '강남점', '홍대점', '광화문점', etc. — "
    "always use the clean, canonical name (e.g., '블루보틀', not '블루보틀 강남점').\n"
    "\n"
    "TOOL CONTRACT (search_place_by_title):\n"
    "- Every place slot (A01/A02/A03/B01) MUST be normalized by calling this tool.\n"
    "- The final JSON MUST be composed ONLY of items copied EXACTLY from the tool results.\n"
    "- Copy rules: {\"title\",\"addr\",\"tel\"} must be copied verbatim (character-by-character). Use \"\" for unknown tel.\n"
    "- If the tool returns 0 or uncertain matches, DISCARD the human title and ideate a new one, then retry (up to 3 times per slot).\n"
    "- Forbidden: meta/directory/area-only entities (e.g., '미쉐린 가이드', '○○ 맛집 지도', '랭킹/리스트/가이드', "
    "'명동/인사동/을지로/이촌' as standalone). Use only concrete places returned by the tool.\n"
    "- Region consistency (HARD): the chosen item's address MUST start with '{region_name}'. If not, discard and retry.\n"
    "- Quota rule: the number of tool calls for search_place_by_title MUST be >= (#places + #accommodations, final-day accommodation excluded).\n"
    "\n"
    "**Concrete Venues Only (HARD):**\n"
    "- You MUST use only concrete venues (a single restaurant/café/attraction/hotel) that can be reserved/visited as a specific POI.\n"
    "- The following are strictly FORBIDDEN as final items unless you pick a specific venue *inside* them and normalize it:\n"
    "  • Neighborhoods/areas/streets: '인사동', '명동', '가로수길', '을지로' etc.\n"
    "  • Transport hubs & generic facilities: '용산역', '서울역', '고속터미널' etc.\n"
    "  • Markets/complexes as a whole: '광장시장', '남대문시장', '동대문시장' etc. (Pick a concrete stall/restaurant/shop within.)\n"
    "  • Region/brand/category/meta terms: '미쉐린 가이드', '○○ 리스트/랭킹/지도', '카페거리', '맛집 골목' etc.\n"
    "- If your ideated title is area-level or meta, you MUST discard it and ideate a concrete venue, then call the tool again.\n"
    "\n"
    "Daily composition **must** satisfy:\n"
    "- At least 2 A01(명소)\n"
    "- At least 2 A02(음식점)\n"
    "- At least 1 A03(카페)\n"
    "- Exactly 1 B01(숙소) (You may reuse the same accommodation for all days except the final day.)\n"
    "\n"
    "Diversity and duplication rules (STRICT):\n"
    "- Each day's schedule must include completely distinct, non-overlapping places.\n"
    "- Absolutely NO place duplication across the entire trip, even if they are different branches of the same brand.\n"
    "- Treat all branches or variants of the same brand as the same place.\n"
    "  Example: '만족오향족발 시청', '만족오향족발 강남역' → all count as duplicates and only ONE may appear in the entire trip.\n"
    "- Before finalizing the plan, normalize each title (lowercase; remove spaces and suffixes like '점','본점','지점', neighborhood suffixes, and branch markers).\n"
    "- If duplicate or branch-level overlap is found, replace it with a new, unique place by re-calling the MCP tool.\n"
    "\n"
    "Template-first planning (MANDATORY):\n"
    "- For EACH day, first construct a **daily slot template** that follows the ORDER & TYPE rules below; then ideate specific places per slot; then call the MCP tool to normalize each slot with a matching-type place.\n"
    "- You MUST fill only with normalized places of the SAME TYPE as the slot (A01→A01, A02→A02, A03→A03, B01→B01).\n"
    "- Adjust the number of places using the dwell-time rules so that the plan tightly fits within the day's time window.\n"
    "\n"
    "Time arrangement and ORDER rules (MANDATORY):\n"
    "- Use the provided start_time/end_time for each day exactly as given.\n"
    "- Build the day's places in the following slot sequence (earlier→later) and with the SAME TYPES per slot:\n"
    "  1) Breakfast: A02 (only if start_time < 10:00; else skip)\n"
    "  2) Morning Attractions: ≥1 A01\n"
    "  3) Lunch: A02 (≈11:30–13:30 window)\n"
    "  4) Afternoon Block: ≥2 items consisting of A01 and at least one A03 (café for rest)\n"
    "  5) Dinner: A02 (≈17:30–20:00 window)\n"
    "  6) Late Attractions: ≥1 A01 (optional if time is tight)\n"
    "  7) Accommodation: B01 (null on the final day)\n"
    "- Do NOT place meals or cafés back-to-back without an attraction (A01) in between whenever possible.\n"
    "- If the day is short (e.g., end_time ≤ 13:00), keep at most one meal (lunch) and ≥1 A01, then end.\n"
    "- If start_time ≥ 10:00, skip breakfast and start from Morning Attractions.\n"
    "\n"
    "Dwell Time & Capacity Planning (HARD):\n"
    "- When constructing each day's itinerary, tightly fill the user-provided start~end window while accounting for travel time between places.\n"
    "- Apply the following per-stop dwell times when building slots:\n"
    "  • A01 (attraction): 1–2 hours per place (default 90–120 minutes; if the schedule is very tight, 60 minutes is allowed)\n"
    "  • A02 (meal): 60 minutes (for breakfast/lunch/dinner alike)\n"
    "  • A03 (café): 60 minutes\n"
    "- Ensure the total sum of dwell times does NOT exceed the given start~end window; adjust the number of places accordingly.\n"
    "- Slack utilization & alignment guide:\n"
    "  • If a segment has ample slack, either extend one A01 dwell up to 2 hours or add one more A01 (respecting no-duplicate/brand-duplicate rules).\n"
    "  • If many stops are back-to-back and feel too dense, insert an A03 (café) or other low-effort rest-style stop to smooth the rhythm.\n"
    "  • If there is an awkward ~1-hour gap around meal times, pull the meal earlier and place an A03 after it, or add a short-visit A01 to eliminate the gap.\n"
    "\n"
    "Planning examples (guidance only; do NOT print):\n"
    "- Short day example: start=10:00, end=15:00 → Skip breakfast; target A01 → A02(lunch) → A01 before dinner window. If timing is awkward, use the slack/alignment guide to shift lunch earlier and insert A03 after, or add a short-visit A01. No dinner/late A01 if outside the window.\n"
    "\n"
    "HARD VALIDATION before output (REQUIRED):\n"
    "- For each day, verify the sequence and type per slot exactly match the ORDER rules and the template-first plan.\n"
    "- Verify counts per type (A01/A02/A03/B01) and the final-day accommodation=null.\n"
    "- Verify every addr starts with '{region_name}'.\n"
    "- If any check fails, you MUST re-ideate and re-call the tool for the failing slots and re-validate before output.\n"
    "- When producing the final JSON, you MUST arrange each day strictly according to the above recipe (order/types/dwell-time rules).\n"
    "\n"
    "Tool acceptance rules:\n"
    "- Only include items that were successfully normalized via MCP tool.\n"
    "- Any item not returned by the tool as a valid match is FORBIDDEN in the final JSON. Never include human-ideated titles that failed normalization.\n"
    "- If a brand/common noun produces ambiguous or no matches in {region_name}, discard it and pick a new unique local place instead.\n"
    "- If multiple matches exist, prefer the one whose address clearly belongs to {region_name}. If uncertain, discard and retry.\n"
    "\n"
    "Retry Strategy (strict):\n"
    "- For each slot, attempt up to 3 distinct candidates. If all fail, choose a different nearby attraction/restaurant/café within the same {region_name} and retry.\n"
    "- Never output a plan containing any unverified or tool-missing place.\n"
    "\n"
    "Meal slot rules (strict):\n"
    "- Lunch and dinner slots must always be filled with concrete A02 restaurant entries, not general areas, markets, or guides.\n"
    "- Market or street names like '광장시장' or '가로수길' may be used only if a specific restaurant inside them was successfully normalized via MCP tool.\n"
    "- Each valid day must include two A02 meals (lunch and dinner). If one fails normalization, retry until two valid A02 restaurants are included.\n"
    "\n"
    "Final-day accommodation rule:\n"
    "- The accommodation for the final day MUST be null (JSON null). Do NOT use \"\" or {}.\n"
    "\n"
    "SELF-CHECKLIST (do not print):\n"
    "1) For each slot, did I call the tool at least once (up to 3 on failure)?\n"
    "2) Did I select exactly one candidate from the tool output for that slot and copy {title,addr,tel} verbatim?\n"
    "3) Are order and types per slot exactly satisfied? (A02→A01→A02→(A01/A03 block)→A02→A01→B01/null)\n"
    "4) Counts OK (A01≥2, A02≥2, A03≥1, B01=1 except last day)?\n"
    "5) No meta/directory/area-only items; no duplicates or brand-branch duplicates across the trip?\n"
    "6) All addresses start with '{region_name}'?\n"
    "7) Is the final-day accommodation null?\n"
    "\n"
    "After all tool calls and validations, output ONLY the final DraftPlanGeminiResponse JSON (no extra text):\n"
